# Mini Widgets

Here are some Mini Widgets we will use to refresh your DOM web development skills.
## Guessing game

Create a guessing game that gives users the chance to guess a number between 1 and 100.

If the guess is to low or too high show the appropriate message of:
* `Your guess is to high`,
* `You guess is to low`,

If the correct number is guessed show this message: `Correct, the secret number is ${number}`

If the widget is refreshed a new secret number is created.

Create a random secret number using `let randomNumber = Math.ceil((Math.random() * 100))`

Possible approaches:

* `innerHTML` with String literal
* `createElement` with `appendChild`
* `innerHTML` with `HandlebarsJS`.

## Country flag list

Given arrays of Country names and flags create a web page that show a list of countries with their flags. 

```js
const countries = ["Argentina", "Brazil", "Chile", "Zambia", "Uganda", "Malawi", "Rwanda", "Ireland", "Switzerland"];

const flags = ["ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡·", "ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡·", "ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡±", "ğŸ‡¿ğŸ‡²", "ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¬", "ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡¼", "ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡¼", "ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡ª", "ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡­"];

```

Deploy your app to GitHub. Once deployed and you shared your URL with the mentors look at the next steps below.

Next steps: 
* add the ability to add more countries,
	* validate input including the flags - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18862256/how-to-detect-emoji-using-javascript
* sort by countries alphabetically by name,
* store the data in localStorage,
* add search support.
